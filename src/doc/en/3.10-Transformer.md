## Transformer Interface

### Purpose of the Transformer

The `Transformer` interface defines a contract for classes or functions that aim to transform data from one type to another. This is particularly useful for converting data between layers of the application, for example, from the persistence layer (database entities) to the domain layer (domain models) or to the presentation layer (DTOs for APIs).

### Interface Definition

A `Transformer` is typically defined by a generic interface with a `transform` method:
```typescript
export interface Transformer<From, To> {
  transform(input: From): To;
}
```

- `From`: The type of the input object to transform.
- `To`: The type of the output object resulting from the transformation.

### Implementing a Transformer

To implement this interface, you would define a class or function that performs the specific transformation required:
```typescript
class UserToUserViewModelTransformer implements Transformer<User, UserViewModel> {
  transform(input: User): UserViewModel {
    return {
      id: input.id,
      fullName: `${input.firstName} ${input.lastName}`,
      email: input.email,
      // Additional transformation logic here...
    };
  }
}
```

In this example, `UserToUserViewModelTransformer` converts a `User` entity into a `UserViewModel` used by the presentation layer.

### Using a Transformer

Transformers can be used in services or request handlers to convert data before sending it to the next layer:
```typescript
function getUserViewModel(userId: string): UserViewModel {
  const user = userRepository.findById(userId);
  const transformer = new UserToUserViewModelTransformer();
  return transformer.transform(user);
}
```

### Best Practices

- Transformers should be pure functions without side effects.
- They should be reusable and easily testable, with clearly defined logic for data mapping.
- In a TypeScript/JavaScript application, transformers can be functions rather than classes if the transformation is straightforward.
