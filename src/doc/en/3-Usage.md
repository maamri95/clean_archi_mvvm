## Usage

After installing and configuring _Clean Architecture MVVM for React_, you are ready to start using it. Here is how you can leverage the features of the project to develop your React front-end applications.

### Quick Start

For a quick start, follow these simple steps:

1. **Launching the Application**: Run the application in development mode with `npm start` or `yarn start`. This will start the development server and open your application in a new browser tab at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Project Structure**: Familiarize yourself with the folder and file structure that follows the principles of clean architecture and the MVVM pattern. Components, entities, views, and other elements are organized intuitively to facilitate navigation and development.

### Available Scripts

Within the project, you can execute several predefined scripts to facilitate development:

- `start`: Launches the application in development mode.
- `build`: Compiles the application for production in the `build` folder.
- `test`: Runs the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

Example of running a script:
```bash
npm run start
```

### Troubleshooting
