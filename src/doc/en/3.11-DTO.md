## Data Transfer Object (DTO)

### Purpose of the DTO

A DTO is an object that transports data between processes, aiming to provide a data transfer layer that is separate from business logic or domain models. DTOs are often used to encapsulate parameters for network method calls or to model API responses.

### Advantages of Using DTOs

- **Separation of Concerns**: They clearly separate data transfer logic from business logic.
- **Network Optimization**: They can be designed to carry only the necessary data, thus reducing overhead.
- **Security**: They help prevent the accidental exposure of internal or sensitive data.
- **Flexibility**: They allow changes to the data structure being transferred without affecting the business logic.

### DTO Structure

The DTO is defined using the `zod` library, which allows not only to declare the shape of the DTO but also to integrate data validation:
```typescript
export const UserSchema = z.object({
  // Field definitions and validations with zod...
});

export type UserDto = z.infer<typeof LeadApiSchema>;
```

### Using a DTO

DTOs are used to map data received from an external call to an internal format, or to prepare domain data to be sent to a client or another subsystem.
```typescript
function createUser(userData: UserDTO): User {
  const user = new User();
  user.id = userData.id;
  user.name = userData.name;
  user.email = userData.email;
  // Assigning other fields from the DTO to the domain model
  return user;
}
```

### Best Practices

- DTOs should be flat and contain no business logic.
- They should be serializable to facilitate network transfer.
- They should be documented so that consumers clearly understand the data structure.
