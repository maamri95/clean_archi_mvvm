## View

### Role of the View

In the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, the View represents the user interface layer that displays data to the user and captures user interactions. In React, a View is typically implemented as a functional component that uses hooks to manage its state and lifecycle.

### Structure of a View

A View is a React component that can consume states and actions from a ViewModel. It focuses exclusively on presentation and delegates all business logic or state to its corresponding ViewModel.

Here is a simple example of a View in React:
```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { useUserViewModel } from './UserViewModel';

function UserView() {
  const { user, loading, error } = useUserViewModel();

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div>Error: {error}</div>;
  }

  if (!user) {
    return <div>No user data available.</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Profile</h1>
      <p>Name: {user.name}</p>
      <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
      {/* ...other user information... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, `UserView` is a View that uses the `useUserViewModel` hook to obtain the user's state and present it.

### Interaction with the View

Views can also include interactive elements, such as buttons or forms, that trigger actions in the ViewModel:
```typescript
function UserView() {
  const { user, setUser, saveUser } = useUserViewModel();

  function handleNameChange(event) {
    setUser({ ...user, name: event.target.value });
  }

  function handleSave() {
    saveUser();
  }

  // View with interactive elements
  return (
    <div>
      <input value={user.name} onChange={handleNameChange} />
      <button onClick={handleSave}>Save</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Best Practices

- A View should be as "dumb" as possible, meaning it does not contain logic other than what is necessary for basic rendering and user interaction.
- Any complex logic or state should be managed by the ViewModel or other custom hooks.
- Views should be easily reusable and composable.
