## Request
In our system, a Request is an interface that represents the set of input data required to execute a use case. Each specific use case will have its own Request interface that extends a base Request interface, thereby providing a consistent structure for all requests within the application.

### Base Request Interface
The base Request interface can be simple and contain no methods or properties, acting as a marker for all use case requests:

```ts
interface Request {}
```

### Defining a Specific Request
To define a Request specific to a use case, you create an interface that extends Request and adds the necessary properties for that use case:
```ts
export const CreateUserRequestSchema = z.object({
     email: string,
     password: string
});

export const CreateUserRequest = z.infer<typeof CreateUserRequestSchema>;
```
In this example, CreateUserRequest is an interface with properties for the email and password, which are the data required to create a user.
