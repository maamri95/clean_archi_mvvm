## DataSource

### Role of the DataSource

The `DataSource` is responsible for the manipulation of data between the infrastructure layer and the domain layer. It provides detailed methods to interact with a data source, allowing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on specific entities.

### Structure of the DataSource Interface

The `DataSource` interface is designed to manage generic entities `T` and includes the following methods:

- `getByUuid(uuid: string)`: Retrieves an entity by its UUID.
- `getAll(options?: PaginationOptions)`: Retrieves all entities with pagination options.
- `create(item: T)`: Creates a new entity.
- `update(uuid: string, item: T)`: Updates an existing entity.
- `delete(uuid: string)`: Deletes an entity.
