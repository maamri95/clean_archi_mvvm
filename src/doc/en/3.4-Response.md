## Response

A `Response` is an interface which defines the structure of the data returned by a use case after it has been executed. As with `Request`, each use case has a specific `Response` which extends a basic `Response` interface. This ensures consistency in the way results are returned throughout the application.

### Basic Response interface

The basic `Response` interface can be very generic, containing the basic information that all responses might include:

```ts
interface Response {}
```

### Defining a Specific Response

For a given use case, you define a `Response` interface which extends this basic interface and adds specific fields to the response for that use case:

```ts
export const CreateUserResponseSchema = z.object({
    userId: z.string()
});

export const CreateUserResponse = z.infer<typeof CreateUserResponseSchema>;
```

Here, `CreateUserResponse` extends `Response` by adding a `userId` field which will be populated if the user creation is successful.
